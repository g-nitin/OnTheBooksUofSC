# Marginalia Removal

The `crop_functions_updated.ipynb` and `test_functs.ipynb` files are originally from UNC, however they were limited in that it didn’t crop the entire volume. So, they were modified to read all files, either .tiff or .jpg, from the given directory for one volume. All the files in that volume are read in one go.

Furthermore, the original versions stopped whenever they encountered a file which threw any kind of error that might have stopped the code from running, such as a failure to crop the file. So, the code was also modified to ignore those errors and keep running. The files which throw errors are stored in a separate csv file, called `errors_year.csv` where year is the year from the volume, in the same directory.

The crop coordinates for other files, which are cropped by the code, are stored in another csv file, `year.csv`, in the same directory.

One important reminder is that some pages are not cropped properly but also don't throw errors. Those pages are not stored in the `errors_year.csv` file, but in the `year.csv` file. The only way to detect them was to manually go through the cell output, which contains a side-by-side view of the original images and their cropped versions, produced by running `test_functs.ipynb` and keeping track of which files are incorrectly cropped.

Lastly, the user should run `test_functs.ipynb` because that notebook calls and utilizes `crop_functions_updated_.py`. However, if the majority of images are not being cropped properly, then it is advised to play with the values of dil_iter, x_buffer, and y_buffer in `crop_functions_updated_.py`.
