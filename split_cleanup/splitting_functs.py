def getActsPaths(dir_OCR):
    """
    This function searches the given OCR directory path to find a path to a 
    text file containing the OCRed output for that year's Acts.
    The function accounts for the fact that there might be many variations in 
    the filename since the Acts and Joints could be seperate or mixed.
    
    Note:
        If the Acts and Joints are seperate for the give year, 
        the acts path will likely contain a filename in the format: 
        `{year}_Acts.txt`.
    
        However, if the Acts and Joints are mixed for the give year, 
        the acts path will might contain a filename as followes: 
        `{year}_both.txt` or `{year}_Acts_Joints.txt`.

    ----------
    dir_OCR : str
        The path for a year's OCR folder.
